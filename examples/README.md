# Running the Samples

Each sample is intended to be ran by running `go run <samplename>.go`



# Basic Info
The `redis_info.go` file will query a localhost Redis server and display
some information pulled from it. It will detail each slave if there are
slaves as well as output some information from the Memory section.

This exmaple demonstrates how to access and use the Info structs for
Redis.
